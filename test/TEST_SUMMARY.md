- `MockNavigatorObserver` - Mock for navigation testing

### 2. `test/test_config.dart`
- Test timeouts and durations
- Test data constants (users, orders, menu items, analytics, marketing)
- Validation regex patterns (email, phone, price)

### 3. `test/run_tests.dart`

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/core/router/auth_state_test.dart

# Run with verbose output
flutter test --verbose
```

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Test Isolation**: ✅ Each test is independent
- **Edge Case Coverage**: ✅ Tests cover success and failure scenarios
- **Async Testing**: ✅ Proper async/await usage
- **Widget Testing**: ✅ Comprehensive widget behavior testing
- **Integration Testing**: ✅ End-to-end app behavior testing
- **Mock Usage**: ✅ Proper mocking for external dependencies

## Areas for Future Testing

As the application grows, consider adding tests for:

1. **Feature Screens**: Menu, Orders, Analytics, Marketing screens
2. **API Integration**: Network calls and data handling
3. **State Management**: More complex state scenarios
4. **Navigation**: Route transitions and deep linking
5. **Form Validation**: Input validation and error handling
6. **Localization**: Multi-language support testing

## Notes

- All tests are currently passing ✅
- Tests handle the Easy Localization warnings gracefully
- Router tests adapted for current go_router version compatibility
- Comprehensive coverage of core functionality
- Well-structured test organization following Flutter best practices
